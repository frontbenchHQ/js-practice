// write all your solution here. 


//1. Create an array named colors that contains five different names of colors as strings.



// 2. Access the first color in the array and print it to the console using console.log()



// 3. Now do the same with the third color in the list. (Remember that array indexes start at 0, not at 1!)



// 4. Write one line of code that changes the value of the last color in the list to "ultraviolet" (overwriting the previous value).



//5. Create a new variable called fourthColor and set it equal to the fourth color in the list.



// 6. Add another color to the end of the list.




// 7. Add another color to the beginning of the list.




// 8. Print the length of the array to the console with console.log()




// 9. Remove the last color from the end of list, and then print the length of the array to the console one more time.



// 10. Write a for loop to iterate through every color in the array and print each color's value to the console.



// 11. Copying from that loop you just wrote, modify it to print every color's value and every color's index in this format: 3, purple or 0, blue etc.



// 12. Create a variable named lastColor that will always point to the last element of the colors array, no matter how many colors are in the list. (Hint: make use of the array's length property for this!)
